      <h2>Why we do what we do</h2>
<p>The ideal of continuously becoming more and more connected is something which the world seems to have embraced. Users are able to connect and communicate with each other all over the globe more than ever before. Mobile devices have become the primary platform to facilitate this far reaching intercommunication. With this ability of being able to communicate with others far away from us we may sometimes forget about the people around us and the effect they can have on us; and why wouldn’t we? There is a safety in knowing that people who we are communicating with online we will for the most part never meet. The communication is always at an ‘arm's length’ distance thus creating a safety. This is especially relevant when meeting new people or approaching someone new to ask a question. It is always easier to ask or approach someone virtually than physically (in real life). This can cause some people to stop seeking out new people and interactions which they may benefit from.  We hope that our app can facilitate and promote physical interactions between new people who you may benefit from each other. In our case we define benefits as important information (i.e. questions about academics or opinions about local restaurants), social life (i.e. making new friends), and entertainment. Facilitating these interactions will be the cornerstone of the design for our app. We feel that within today’s cities, despite the dense concentration of people, we are more disconnected from each other than those inside small rural communities. For every person living in densely populated areas there exists the untapped potential from all the people around them. Our mission is to attempt to connect the people around us.
